## **Approaches to training ML programs**

Recall that **machine learning** is a subset of AI focused on developing computer programs that can analyze data to make decisions or predictions. AI designers often use ML in their AI programs because it doesn’t have the limitations of rule-based techniques.

There are three common approaches to training ML programs:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

### **Supervised learning**

In this approach, the ML program learns from a *labeled* training set. A labeled training set includes data that is labeled or tagged, which provides context and meaning to the data. For instance, an email spam filter that's trained with supervised learning would use a training set of emails that are labeled as *“spam”* or *“not spam.”* Supervised learning is often used when there's a specific output in mind*.*

### **Unsupervised learning**

In this approach, the ML program learns from an *unlabeled* training set. An unlabeled training set includes data that does not have labels or tags. For instance, ML might be used to analyze a dataset of unsorted  email messages and find patterns in topics, keywords, or contacts. In other words, unsupervised learning is used to identify patterns in data without a specific output in mind.

### **Reinforcement learning**

In this approach, the ML program uses trial-and-error to learn which actions lead to the best outcome. The program learns to do this by getting rewarded for making good choices that lead to the desired results. Reinforcement learning is commonly used by conversational AI tools. As these tools receive feedback from users and AI designers, they learn to generate effective responses.

Each ML technique has its own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on the type of data that's available and what's needed to solve the particular problem, AI designers may use one, two, or all three of these techniques to produce an AI-powered solution.

## **Generative AI**

Advancements in machine learning have helped pave the way for **generative AI**—AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. This type of AI often uses a combination of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to create original content.

For instance, all three approaches play distinct roles in conversational AI tools. Supervised learning equips conversational AI tools with foundational dialogue data, enabling them to respond to common conversational cues appropriately. Unsupervised learning enables them to interpret nuances in language, like colloquialisms, that occur naturally in conversation. Reinforcement learning further strengthens these tools by allowing them to improve their responses in real-time based on user feedback. This enables them to adapt to the conversational context and engage in natural conversations.

Generative AI's ability to create and innovate offers a range of benefits to all sorts of workplaces and professions, such as marketing, product development, engineering, education, manufacturing, and research and development. These benefits include:

- **Greater efficiency:** Generative AI can automate or augment routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on other work priorities.
- **Personalized experiences:** Generative AI can tailor its interactions to individual preferences and needs.
- **Better decisions:** Generative AI can quickly analyze vast amounts of data to uncover useful insights.

These are just some of the ways that generative AI can enhance your work.
